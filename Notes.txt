Main Advantages (Commonly Discussed):
	Inheritance - one class acquires the properties of another
	Polymorphism - ability of an object to look like another object, and thus have different operations defined
	Abstraction - hide complexities from the user
	Encapsulation - nesting objects, data hiding

Main Advantages (My Version):
	Focus on Architecture
	Modularity

	Abstraction == Readability

	SRP - Single Responsibility
	DRY principle - Don't Repeat yourself!
	KIS principle - Keep it simple

	Readability
	Writability
	Flexibility
	... very parful
